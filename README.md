## 🚀 Project Status: Ongoing Advancement
I am currently refactoring this project to improve its architecture. 

### Current Milestone: Modularization
I have successfully transitioned the core logic out of the initial script (**todo.py**) and into a dedicated logic module (**todo_logic.py**). This allows the application to be more scalable and easier to test as I move toward a Web-based interface.

### 🛠 Recent Improvements
- [x] **Logic Extraction:** Decoupled task management from the User Interface.
- [x] **File Structure:** Cleaned up the repository and implemented a `.gitignore` for better environment management.
- [wip] **Web Integration:** Currently building out `app.py` to serve the application via Flask.
